The explanatory analysis and preprocessing is nicely performed and contains insightful visualizations. The formatting of the report could have been improved. The modeling part using LSTM and Prophet seems approprate. Nice ablation study comparing batch size against Prophet accuracy and number of units vs R2 score. The code however lacks appropriate commenting. Also, the code could have been better organized (e.g., see Lab-4).
